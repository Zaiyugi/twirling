Based on the paper Twirling Sculptures by Ergun Akleman

Build:
Run from top directory
	make all
	make launch

Note on building:
	I used OpenMesh for storing and writing the surfaces.
	You might need to modify the OPENMESH variables in the Makefile to have the right paths.

Run: 
	./launch

While program is running:

	Subdivisions control surface subdivisions; Subdivided Bezier not included
	Doo-Sabin subdivision is used and should work for all cases

	When Importing/Exporting, the Surface Name field is the path/name of the file, minus the extension.
	So "models/icosa.obj" becomes "models/icosa". 

	Extrusion is controlled by selection and the type. Each type will consider only the faces selected, so to
	extrude all faces, select all faces. Otherwise, switch to 'Select' mode and select the desired region.

	Extrusion runs per face, not per region; extruding a region of faces is no different than extruding each
	face individually. 

	When extruding along a path, then step size and step count parameters are ignored; the number of steps and
	size of each is determined by the number of points and distance between them on the path.

	I added several editing commands; they're grouped under main controls. They should make manipulating surfaces
	easier. A history is also kept, so you can undo some commands. 

	Both extrusion and subdivision rely on application. To subdivide, set the number of subdivisions desired and
	press 'Apply Subdivisions'. A new mesh, reflecting that subdivision, will be pushed onto the top of the
	history. The same applies to extrusion.
